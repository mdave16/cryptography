# Crypography
This is a small web page as part of [my website hosted on github](https://mdave16.github.io). The aim is for me to practice both my react skills and also have some fun learning about different encryption and decryption techniques.

## Local Development
To get started, you just neeed to run

    yarn install

There are a number of scripts available to help you perform tasks with yarn.

    yarn start

Starts the development server on port 3000

    yarn test

Starts the test runner.

    yarn deploy

This will deploy the current version of the application and make it live!

Happy hacking!
